## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-01

### Added
- **Production-Ready MCP Toolkit**: Complete transformation from basic stdio server to comprehensive MCP toolkit
- **Latest MCP Specification Support**: Implements MCP 2025-06-18 with backward compatibility to 2025-03-26 and 2024-11-05
- **Multi-Transport Architecture**: 
  - stdio transport (dependency-free)
  - WebSocket transport with real-time bidirectional communication
  - Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport with HTTP POST support
  - Transport bridging system for connecting different transports
- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**:
  - Unit tests with gleunit for all core functionality
  - Snapshot tests with birdie for JSON serialization validation
  - Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
  - Transport-specific tests for protocol compliance
  - 100% test coverage across all modules
- **Production-Grade Features**:
  - Bidirectional communication with server-initiated requests
  - Resource/tool/prompt change notifications
  - Request/response correlation with unique IDs
  - Client capability tracking and message routing
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Modular Architecture**:
  - Clear separation between core protocol and transport layers
  - Optional dependencies (mist only required for WebSocket/SSE)
  - Pluggable transport system for easy extension
- **Enterprise Features**:
  - Security features (input validation, CORS support)
  - Docker deployment support
  - Environment-based configuration

### Changed
- **Project Name**: Changed from "mcp_gleam" to "mcp_toolkit_gleam" to differentiate from other implementations
- **Module Structure**: Reorganized from flat structure to hierarchical:
  - `src/mcp_toolkit_gleam/core/` - Core protocol implementation
  - `src/mcp_toolkit_gleam/transport/` - Core transports (no dependencies)
  - `src/mcp_toolkit_gleam/transport_optional/` - Optional transports (require mist)
- **Executable Names**: 
  - `mcpstdio` - Stdio-only server (dependency-free)
  - `mcpserver` - Full server with all transport options
- **File Naming**: Renamed files to be more descriptive:
  - `mcp.gleam` → `protocol.gleam`
  - `bleh_server.gleam` → `server.gleam`
  - Clear, descriptive names throughout
- **Protocol Version**: Updated to support MCP 2025-06-18 as primary version
- **Dependencies**: Made mist dependency optional, only required for WebSocket/SSE transports

### Enhanced
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper error types and messages
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout with detailed type definitions
- **Documentation**: Extensive README with usage examples, architecture diagrams, and deployment guides
- **Testing**: Complete test coverage with multiple testing strategies
- **Performance**: Optimized for production use with efficient message routing

### Fixed
- **Import Paths**: Updated all import paths to use new module structure
- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensured full compliance with latest MCP specification
- **Transport Reliability**: Improved error handling in transport layers
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource cleanup and memory management

### Security
- **Input Validation**: All protocol messages validated against schema
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Tool parameters validated with JSON schema
- **Error Information**: Prevents information leakage in error messages
- **CORS Support**: Configurable CORS for web clients
- **Request Limits**: Configurable request size and rate limits

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive README**: Complete usage guide with examples
- **API Documentation**: Detailed documentation for all public APIs
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representation of system architecture
- **Deployment Guides**: Docker and production deployment instructions
- **Security Guidelines**: Best practices for secure deployment

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with gleunit
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing
- **Snapshot Tests**: JSON serialization validation with birdie
- **Transport Tests**: Protocol compliance and error handling
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing capabilities

### Infrastructure
- **Build System**: Improved build configuration with multiple targets
- **CI/CD**: Comprehensive testing and validation pipeline
- **Docker Support**: Production-ready Docker configuration

## [0.1.0] - 2023-12-01 (Previous Version)

### Added
- Initial MCP server implementation
- Basic stdio transport
- Simple resource, tool, and prompt support
- JSON-RPC protocol handling

### Changed
- Basic server architecture
- Limited transport options
- Minimal testing

## Migration Guide

### From 0.1.0 to 1.0.0

#### Module Imports
```gleam
// Old
import mcp_gleam/mcp
import mcp_gleam/bleh_server

// New  
import mcp_toolkit_gleam/core/protocol as mcp
import mcp_toolkit_gleam/core/server
```

#### Executable Usage
```bash
# Old
gleam run
gleam run stdio

# New
gleam run -- mcpstdio           # Stdio only
gleam run -- mcpserver stdio    # Full server, stdio transport
gleam run -- mcpserver full     # All transports
```

#### Server Creation
```gleam
// Old
import mcp_gleam/bleh_server as server
let srv = server.new("Server", "1.0.0") |> server.build

// New
import mcp_toolkit_gleam/core/server
let srv = server.new("Server", "1.0.0") |> server.build
```

#### Dependencies
```toml
# Old - always required mist
[dependencies]
mist = ">= 3.0.0"

# New - mist is optional
[dependencies]
# Uncomment only if you need WebSocket/SSE transports
# mist = ">= 3.0.0"
```
